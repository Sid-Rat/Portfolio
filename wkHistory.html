        <h2>My Origan Story</h2>
        <h3>For a detailed work history: <a href="https://my.indeed.com/p/timothyh-lu6fgms"></br> <img src="art/resume.png"></a> </h3>
        <hr></br>
        <p>I grew up in a restaurant family. So, I unofficially have been working since I could stand.</p>
        <p>I officially joined the workforce my senior year of high school when I began cooking full-time at the local tourist stop, Das Dutchman Essenhaus. I needed to start my shift before the school day was over so I worked out an agreement with the school principal to depart early. I then cooked in and managed a few restaurants until I got married.
        </p><p>After I got married, I obtained my Commercial Driver’s License and was an over-the-road truck driver for almost ten years. Once my daughter was born, I worked for an excavating company to be home more with my family. But the restaurant business was in my blood, so I eventually bought and ran the family café in my hometown – the County Seat Café. The restaurant business is very challenging so when I received an offer to sell after ten years I took it!
        </p><p>That led to my job working the night shift at Polywood, a company that manufactures furniture from landfill-bound and ocean-bound plastics. I liked the job, and I liked the night shift, but the factory life got to be too much for me. Through my hobby of gaming and digital character design I discovered a passion for coding. I was about a quarter of the way through my first game when I realized I was quite good at coding in Python. That leads me to, hopefully, the last chapter of long and eventful work experiences.
        </p><p>In early 2021, I started my business SidRat Games, and began building websites for local businesses. After several months of ramen noodles and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, I decided to enroll at <a href= "https://www.elevenfifty.org">Eleven Fifty Academy.</a> I have learned a great deal to augment my self-taught coding knowledge. Most importantly, I have learned coding structure and industry standards. I have a thirst for code in general and, whatever path I choose, I will always be learning new ways to develop software.</p>
