        <h1>My Origan Story</h1>
        <h3>For a detailed work history: <a href="https://my.indeed.com/p/timothyh-lu6fgms"></br> <img src="art/resume.png"></a> </h3>
        <hr></br>
        <p>I grew up in a restaurant family. So, I unofficially have been working since I could stand.</br>
    I officially joined the workforce my senior year of high school. My father was on disability so I got a full time job cooking at the local tourist stop, the Essenhause. I had to clock in before school was out so I worked out an early release agreement with the principal.
    I cooked in, and managed a couple of restaurants until I got married and started a family.</br></br>
    It was then that I felt like I should have a career, so I went to school for a CDL. I was an over the road truck driver for almost ten years, and yes, I did manage to be home enough to start that family. My daughter was born in '01, and I was home to see her birth. About a year later I got a job hauling equipment for an excavating company so I could be home with my family. Unfortunately all that home time lead to my divorce. After a rough couple of years with alcohol I sobered up and bought my family business.</br></br>
    I took the advise of my accountant and started the umbrella company Maple Leaf Ventures. Under that umbrella I mainly owned and operated the County Seat Cafe. After just shy of ten years I got an offer to sell, and took it.<br>
    That lead to my job working the night shift at Polywood. I liked the job, and I liked the night shift, but the factory life got to be too much for me. Through my hobby of gaming and digital character design I discoverd a passion for coding. I was about a quarter of the way through my first game when I discovered I was quite good at coding in <b>Python</b>. That leads me to, hopefully, the last chapter of a long and eventful work experiences.</p>
    <p>In early 2021 I started my business SidRat Games and began building websites for local business. After several months of ramon noodles and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches I decided to enroll at <a href="https://elevenfifty.org">Eleven Fifty Academy.</a>I have learned a great deal to support my self taught knowledge of code. Most importantly I have learned coding structure and industry standards. I have a thirst for code in general, and whatever path I choose, I will always be learning new ways to develope software.   </p>
